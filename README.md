An ancient DNA relatedness pipeline for ultra-low coverage whole genome shotgun data







- PLINK frequency file was generated from 1000 Genomes Phase 3 CEU population. The only QC step required is to exclude fixed SNPs, reducing from 77 to 22 million variants
(maybe have default EUR files, where both the BED file and FRQ file have no fixed SNPs, will make things much faster)
